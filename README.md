## Project Overview

A pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images and use a CNN model to predict where the image was taken.

Images at various landmarks were collected and preprocessed to feed into a CNN model. A simple app was make in the app.ipynb file to allow a user to upload an image and 5 predicitions with varying probabilities would be make about the images location.
